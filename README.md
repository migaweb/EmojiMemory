# Emoji Memory

A simple memory matching game built with Blazor WebAssembly. The project is intended as a playful demonstration of .NET's UI capabilities while following the ideas laid out in [Emoji_Memory_Game_Design.md](Emoji_Memory_Game_Design.md).

## Getting Started

1. Ensure the .NET SDK is installed.
2. Navigate to the UI project:
   ```bash
   cd UI/EmojiMemory.UI
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Open the printed local address in your browser to play.
